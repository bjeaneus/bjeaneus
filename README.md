- 👋 Hi, I’m Jonathan. I am a finance and transformation leader by day, and python/data enthusiast by night.
- 👀 I’m interested in machine learning (i.e., supervised and unsupervised), optimizations, quantitative finance, and sports. Moreover, I like to solve complex problems by invesigating data.
- 🌱 I'm always looking for new methods to apply. That said, I'm constantly learning. My focus is generally fluid.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on optimazation problems and any other topics which will readily address emergant problems.
